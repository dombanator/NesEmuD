Bit 7 of PPU Control 1 Reg

When turning on the NMI flag in bit 7, if the PPU is currently in vertical blank 
and the PPUSTATUS ($2002) vblank flag is set, an NMI will be generated immediately. 
This can result in graphical errors (most likely a misplaced scroll) if the NMI routine
 is executed too late in the blanking period to finish on time. To avoid this problem 
it is prudent to read $2002 immediately before writing $2000 to clear the vblank flag.



PPU Status Reg

Vertical blank has started (0: not in vblank; 1: in vblank).
Set at dot 1 of line 241 (the line *after* the post-render line); 
cleared after reading $2002 and at dot 1 of the pre-render line.

Caution: Reading PPUSTATUS at the exact start of vertical blank will return 0 in bit 7 
but clear the latch anyway, causing the program to miss frames





Scanline 241 cycle 1

The VBlank flag of the PPU is set at tick 1 (the second tick) of scanline 241, where the VBlank NMI also occurs
