Plan

-create basic memory
	- allocate once, then divide out to pointers, NES has fixed ram sizes to run in
	- three registers A, X, Y.
	- pointer to the line of code currently located at.
	
-load .nes files
	-create struct that holds the details of the file. 
	-check first 4 bytes equal NES
	-create a header struct and read in, details on web
	-load program data, and char data.
	
-start running program code
	-parse by looking at each instruction and send to a function.
	-when a opcode comes that I don't have, research and create.
